# Backpack Scoping Fix - User-Specific Saved Sets

## Problem Description

The original implementation had a critical issue where saved sets (backpack) were not scoped per user. This meant:

- All users shared the same backpack data
- User A could see User B's saved sets
- Removing a set would affect all users
- The "API unsave failed" error occurred because the system couldn't properly identify which user's data to modify

## Root Cause

1. **Backend API**: The save/unsave operations were not properly filtering by `user_id`
2. **Frontend Storage**: AsyncStorage was using a global key (`backpackSets`) instead of user-scoped keys
3. **Missing API Endpoint**: No dedicated endpoint to fetch a user's backpack sets

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API Fixes

#### Updated `/api/set/save` endpoint
- **File**: `backend/app/api/set/save/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - All save/unsave operations now properly filter by `user_id` from JWT token
  - Save operation: `user_id: decoded.user_id` in SetSave creation
  - Unsave operation: `user_id: decoded.user_id` in SetSave deletion
  - GET endpoint returns user-specific save status

#### New `/api/set/backpack` endpoint
- **File**: `backend/app/api/set/backpack/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Fetch all sets saved by the current user
- **Features**:
  - Returns complete set data with creator info and cards
  - Properly scoped to authenticated user
  - Includes learner count for each set

### 2. Frontend Service Updates

#### Enhanced `setSaveService.ts`
- **File**: `studybuddy/services/setSaveService.ts`
- **New Functions**:
  - `getBackpackStorageKey(userId)`: Creates user-scoped storage keys
  - `getCurrentUserId()`: Extracts user ID from AsyncStorage
  - `fetchBackpackSets()`: Fetches backpack from API
  - `saveBackpackToStorage()`: Saves to user-scoped storage
  - `loadBackpackFromStorage()`: Loads from user-scoped storage
  - `clearBackpackStorage()`: Clears user-scoped storage

#### User-Scoped Storage Keys
- **Before**: `backpackSets` (global)
- **After**: `backpackSets_${userId}` (user-scoped)

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

#### Updated `card.tsx`
- **File**: `studybuddy/app/(tabs)/card.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Uses new user-scoped storage functions
  - Fetches backpack from API first, falls back to local storage
  - Proper error handling and rollback on API failures

#### Updated `home.tsx`
- **File**: `studybuddy/app/(tabs)/home.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Uses new user-scoped storage functions
  - Consistent with card.tsx implementation

#### Updated `AuthContext.tsx`
- **File**: `studybuddy/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Clears user-scoped backpack storage on logout
  - Prevents data leakage between users

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Manual Testing

#### Test Case 1: User Isolation
1. Create User A → save a set → log out
2. Create User B → should have empty backpack
3. Save a set as User B → logout → login User A
4. User A should still see only their own backpack

#### Test Case 2: Set Removal
1. User A saves a set
2. User B saves the same set
3. User A removes the set
4. User B should still have the set in their backpack

#### Test Case 3: Logout Cleanup
1. User A saves several sets
2. User A logs out
3. User B logs in
4. User B should not see User A's sets

### 2. Automated Testing

#### Run the Test Script
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test-backpack-scoping.js
```

This script will:
- Create two test users
- Create test sets
- Test save/remove operations
- Verify user isolation
- Check database integrity

### 3. API Testing

#### Test Save Operation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/set/save \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"set_id": "SET_ID", "action": "save"}'
```

#### Test Fetch Backpack
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/set/backpack \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Test Remove Operation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/set/save \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"set_id": "SET_ID", "action": "unsave"}'
```

## Database Schema

The solution uses the existing `SetSave` table with proper user scoping:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "SetSave" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "user_id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "set_id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "saved_at" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT "SetSave_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

-- Unique constraint ensures one save per user per set
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "SetSave_user_id_set_id_key" ON "SetSave"("user_id", "set_id");
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling
- API failures fall back to local storage
- Rollback local changes if API fails
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

### Backend Error Handling
- Proper JWT validation
- UUID format validation
- Set existence verification
- Comprehensive error logging

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Frontend caches backpack data locally
- API provides fresh data on each fetch
- Fallback to cached data if API unavailable

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries on `user_id` and `set_id`
- Efficient joins with user and set data
- Pagination support for large backpacks

## Security Improvements

### User Isolation
- All operations scoped to authenticated user
- JWT token validation on every request
- No cross-user data access

### Data Integrity
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate saves
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Transaction-based operations

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- Existing `backpackSets` in AsyncStorage will be migrated automatically
- Users will see their data preserved after the update
- No manual migration required

### Backward Compatibility
- API maintains existing response formats
- Frontend gracefully handles missing user data
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging
- Comprehensive error logging with context
- User ID tracking in all operations
- Performance metrics for API calls

### Debug Tools
- Test script for validation
- Database queries for verification
- Frontend console logging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live backpack updates
2. **Offline Sync**: Better offline/online synchronization
3. **Bulk Operations**: Batch save/remove operations
4. **Analytics**: Track popular sets and user behavior
5. **Sharing**: Allow users to share backpack sets

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Pagination**: Handle large backpacks efficiently
2. **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
3. **CDN**: Static asset optimization
4. **Database**: Read replicas for high-traffic scenarios

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that:
- ✅ Each user has their own isolated backpack
- ✅ No cross-user data contamination
- ✅ Proper error handling and rollback
- ✅ Secure user authentication
- ✅ Scalable and maintainable code
- ✅ Comprehensive testing coverage

The "API unsave failed" error should now be resolved, and users will have a properly scoped backpack experience.
